# Team Project 1: Dinner and a Movie
Made by Nadine Paez Andrade, Jay Ibarra, Mladen Makivic, and Keshia-Lee Martin

## Project Details
For our project, we created a page called Dinner and a Movie. From a dropdown choice user can choose a genre and click the submit button. Then user will be provided with a random movie and food selection. The webpage will show a movie poster, movie info (title, actors, plot, rating), and a food image. We used two APIs: The Open Movie Database (OMDb) and Foodish. For our CSS Framework, we used Bulma.

## Dinner and a Movie Link
The following link navigates to Dinner and a Movie: https://jayibarra.github.io/movies/

The user then can select from a variety of genres in the dropdown.

Once the user selects a genre and presses "Submit" they are presented with the movie Title, Year of Release, Actors, Plot, and Rotten Tomatoes Rating. They are also shown the movie poster. To the right of the poster, the user is also provided with a photo of a food pairing.

Previously suggested movie titles are saved to the local storage and shown at the bottom of the page. The title history can be cleared with a clear button.
